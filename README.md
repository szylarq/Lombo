# Lombo
A pawnshop operation support software; created for the purpose of my final bachelor project.

It is a desktop app created using Java and its framework JavaFX. 

To build executable .jar file from the IntelliJ IDE:
1. Project structure -> artifacts -> '+' -> JAR -> From modeules with dependencies
2. Choose main class: lombo.Main
3. Make sure the option "extract to the target JAR" is set
4. OK -> Apply -> Close
5. Build -> Build Artifcats... -> Lombo:jar -> Build
